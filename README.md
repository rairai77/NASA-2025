### 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge Submission ***"Your Home in Space: The Habitat Layout Creator"***

CrossPaths is an easy-to-use, visualizer tool designed to support habitat layout planning for long-duration space missions. By approaching architectural design through the perspective of social interactions, we emphasize human-centered design, often undervalued, as the guiding principle of space habitat layout rather than starting from an engineering, industrial, or technical perspective. While traditional space habitat designs often prioritize engineering constraints like pressurized volume and rocket size, CrossPaths focuses on how crew members interact with their environment and each other, supporting better social dynamics during extended missions. This tool models time, space, and people by visualizing crew members moving from space to space and their interactions within the habitat. The Sankey diagram layout allows for a clear visualization of how individuals occupy and transition between spaces over time, highlighting patterns of movement, shared use of areas, and potential bottlenecks. It helps identify when and where interactions occur, supporting better zoning for privacy, collaboration, and mental well-being.
